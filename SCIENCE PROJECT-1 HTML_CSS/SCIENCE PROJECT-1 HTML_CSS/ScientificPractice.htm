    <h1><q>Scientific Practice</q></h1>
    <p>Although encyclopedias such as Pliny's (fl. 77 AD) Natural History offered purported fact, they proved unreliable. A skeptical point of view, demanding a method of proof, was the practical position taken to deal with unreliable knowledge. As early as 1000 years ago, scholars such as Alhazen (Doubts Concerning Ptolemy), Roger Bacon, Witelo, John Pecham, Francis Bacon (1605), and C. S. Peirce (1839â€“1914) provided the community to address these points of uncertainty. In particular, fallacious reasoning can be exposed, such as "affirming the consequent."</p><br/>
    <p>"If a man will begin with certainties, he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts, he shall end in certainties."</p><br/>
    <p>The methods of inquiry into a problem have been known for thousands of years,and extend beyond theory to practice. The use of measurements, for example, is a practical approach to settle disputes in the community.</p><br/>
    <p>John Ziman points out that intersubjective pattern recognition is fundamental to the creation of all scientific knowledge. Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as "perceptual consensibility."He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge</p>
