    <h1>20TH CENTURY AND BEYOND</h1>
    <p>Einstein's theory of relativity and the development of quantum mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.</p><br/>
    <p>In the first half of the century, the development of artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible. At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of "atomic energy" (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive use of scientific innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to antibiotics and increased life expectancy, revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race, all giving a widespread public appreciation of the importance of modern science.</p><br/>
    <p>Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones.</p><br/>
    <p>More recently, it has been argued that the ultimate purpose of science is to make sense of human beings and our nature. For example, in his book Consilience, E. O. Wilson said: "The human condition is the most important frontier of the natural sciences".</p><hr/>
